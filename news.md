# galamm version 0.1.0

Initial version. Provides the galamm() function for estimating generalized
additive mixed models with factor structures using profile likelihood
estimation. The marginal_likelihood() function computes the
likelihood of these models at given parameter values, and also provides the
gradient evaluated to machine precision using automatic differentiation.
