\title{Extract the model frame from a galamm object}
\usage{
\method{model.frame}{galamm}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of type \code{galamm} as described in \link{galammObject}.}

\item{...}{Ignored – present for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the variables that were used in the fit.
}
\description{
Returns the data frame that was used to fit the model. The function first
looks for a component named \code{data} (added by the \code{galamm()} function).  If
that component is missing it falls back to re‑evaluating the expression
supplied in the original call (\code{call$data}).  This mirrors the behavior
of \code{model.frame.lmerMod} and other modelling packages.
