  abstract = {In this article, the authors suggest a profile-likelihood approach for estimating complex models by maximum likelihood (ML) using standard software and minimal programming. The method works whenever setting some of the parameters of the model to known constants turns the model into a standard model. An important class of models that can be estimated this way is generalized linear mixed models with factor structures. Such models are useful in educational research, for example, for estimation of value-added teacher or school effects with persistence parameters and for analysis of large-scale assessment data using multilevel item response models with discrimination parameters. The authors describe the profile-likelihood approach, implement it in the R software, and apply the method to longitudinal data and binary item response data. Simulation studies and comparison with gllamm show that the profile-likelihood method performs well in both types of applications. The authors also briefly discuss other types of models that can be estimated using the profile-likelihood idea.},

  abstract = {A unifying framework for generalized multilevel structural equation modeling is introduced. The models in the framework, called generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM) and consist of a response model and a structural model for the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs to incorporate factor structures in addition to random intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced with different numbers of lower-level units in the higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of response processes can be modeled including ordered and unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of mixed types. The structural model is similar to the structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. For example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a freely available program running in Stata.},

  abstract = {Measurement models, such as factor analysis and item response theory models, are commonly implemented within educational, psychological, and behavioral science research to mitigate the negative effects of measurement error. These models can be formulated as an extension of generalized linear mixed models within a unifying framework that encompasses various kinds of multilevel models and longitudinal models, such as partially nonlinear latent growth models. We introduce the R package PLmixed, which implements profile maximum likelihood estimation to estimate complex measurement and growth models that can be formulated within the general modeling framework using the existing R package lme4 and function optim. We demonstrate the use of PLmixed through two examples before concluding with a brief overview of other possible models.},

A profile likelihood algorithm is proposed, and we derive asymptotic standard errors of both smooth and parametric terms. The work was motivated by applications in cognitive neuroscience, and we show how GALAMMs can successfully model the complex lifespan trajectory of latent episodic memory, along with a discrepant trajectory of working memory, as well as the effect of latent socioeconomic status on hippocampal development. Simulation experiments suggest that model estimates are accurate even with moderate sample sizes.},
