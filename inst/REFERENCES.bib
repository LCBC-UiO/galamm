  abstract = {Statistical approaches to overdispersion, correlated errors, shrinkage estimation, and smoothing of regression relationships may be encompassed within the framework of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Given an unobserved vector of random effects, observations are assumed to be conditionally independent with means that depend on the linear predictor through a specified link function and conditional variances that are specified by a variance function, known prior weights and a scale factor. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and dispersion matrix depending on unknown variance components. For problems involving time series, spatial aggregation and smoothing, the dispersion may be specified in terms of a rank deficient inverse covariance matrix. Approximation of the marginal quasi-likelihood using Laplace's method leads eventually to estimating equations based on penalized quasilikelihood or PQL for the mean parameters and pseudo-likelihood for the variances. Implementation involves repeated calls to normal theory procedures for REML estimation in variance components problems. By means of informal mathematical arguments, simulations and a series of worked examples, we conclude that PQL is of practical value for approximate inference on parameters and realizations of random effects in the hierarchical model. The applications cover overdispersion in binomial proportions of seed germination; longitudinal analysis of attack rates in epilepsy patients; smoothing of birth cohort effects in an age-cohort model of breast cancer incidence; evaluation of curvature of birth cohort effects in a case-control study of childhood cancer and obstetric radiation; spatial aggregation of lip cancer rates in Scottish counties; and the success of salamander matings in a complicated experiment involving crossing of male and female effects. PQL tends to underestimate somewhat the variance components and (in absolute value) fixed effects when applied to clustered binary data, but the situation improves rapidly for binomial observations having denominators greater than one.},

We call {\^\texttheta} a pseudo maximum likelihood estimate of \texttheta, and give conditions under which {\^\texttheta} is consistent and asymptotically normal. Pseudo maximum likelihood estimation easily extends to k-parameter models, and is of interest in problems in which the likelihood surface is ill-behaved in higher dimensions but well-behaved in lower dimensions. We examine several signal-plus-noise, or convolution, models which exhibit such behavior and satisfy the regularity conditions of the asymptotic theory. For specific models, a numerical comparison of asymptotic variances suggests that a pseudo maximum likelihood estimate of the signal parameter is uniformly more efficient than estimators proposed previously.},

Such models are useful in educational research, for example, for estimation of value-added teacher or school effects with persistence parameters and for analysis of large-scale assessment data using multilevel item response models with discrimination parameters. The authors describe the profile-likelihood approach, implement it in the R software, and apply the method to longitudinal data and binary item response data. Simulation studies and comparison with gllamm show that the profile-likelihood method performs well in both types of applications. The authors also briefly discuss other types of models that can be estimated using the profile-likelihood idea.},

In this paper, for a few factors we do calculations for a variety of mixed models to show patterns in the asymptotic bias of the estimator based on the maximum of the Laplace approximation of the log-likelihood. The biggest factor for asymptotic bias is the amount of discreteness in the response variable; there is more bias for binary and ordinal responses than for a count response, and more bias for a count response when its support is mainly near 0. When there is bias, the bias decreases as the cluster size increases. Often, the Laplace approximation is adequate even for small cluster sizes. Even with bias, the Laplace approximation may be adequate for quick assessment of competing mixed models with different random effects and covariates.},

In many studies, however, different interchangeable raters (e.g., peers, subordinates) are asked to rate different targets (students, supervisors), leading to violations of the independence assumption and to cross-classified data structures. In the present work, we extend the ML-CFA-MTMM model by Eid and colleagues (2008) to cross-classified multirater designs. The new C4 model (Cross-Classified CTC[M-1] Combination of Methods) accounts for nonindependent interchangeable raters and enables researchers to explicitly model the interaction between targets and raters as a latent variable. Using a real data application, it is shown how credibility intervals of model parameters and different variance components can be obtained using Bayesian estimation techniques.},

A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed.

In this article, we present a general multivariate, longitudinal mixed-model that incorporates the complex grouping structures inherent to longitudinal student data linked to teachers. We summarize the principal existing modeling approaches, show how these approaches are special cases of the proposed model, and discuss possible extensions to model more complex data structures. We present simulation and analytical results that clarify the interplay between estimated teacher effects and repeated outcomes on students over time. We also explore the potential impact of model misspecifications, including missing student covariates and assumptions about the accumulation of teacher effects over time, on key inferences made from the models. We conclude that mixed models that account for student correlation over time are reasonably robust to such misspecifications when all the schools in the sample serve similar student populations. However, student characteristics are likely to confound estimated teacher effects when schools serve distinctly different populations.},

Energy intake reflects physical activity, but the advantage of a diet high in cereal fibre cannot be explained; there was no evidence that the disease was associated with consumption of refined carbohydrates.

This test comprises two modalities, digits forward and digits backward. It has been established that age, education, and culture are important variables that affect performance on this test. The purposes of this study were as follows. First, performance on digit span in a Spanish-speaking sample was analysed to establish appropriate age and educational ranges in which data from the Digit Span test can be best analysed, and to determine the contribution of age and education to performance on the digit span forward and backward. Second, different studies on digit span were compared and reviewed in order to identify differences in terms of the variables of age, education, and culture. This study evaluated 2574 Spanish-speaking subjects and three studies were included in the cross-cultural analysis. Scores from the Spanish-speaking sample were matched with the data presented by the other studies according to age and level of education. Results showed that the stronger predicting variable in the Spanish-speaking sample was the level of education, both for digits forward and backward. Regarding culture, differences were found among the studies on digit span for both the forward and backward conditions. It can be argued that learning to read and write affects the development or usage of the abilities measured by the Digit Span task, and that cultural variables such as language and quality of education might also contribute to the differences found between countries.},

This problem can potentially be rectified by using generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), including a measurement model for the relationship between observed and true covariates. However, the models are typically estimated under the assumption that both the true covariates and the measurement errors are normally distributed, although skewed covariate distributions are often observed in practice. In this article we relax the normality assumption for the true covariates by developing nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE) for GLLAMMs. The methodology is applied to estimating the effect of dietary fibre intake on coronary heart disease. We also assess the performance of estimation of regression parameters and empirical Bayes prediction of the true covariate. Normal as well as skewed covariate distributions are simulated and inference is performed based on both maximum likelihood assuming normality and NPMLE. Both estimators are unbiased and have similar root mean square errors when the true covariate is normal. With a skewed covariate, the conventional estimator is biased but has a smaller mean square error than the NPMLE. NPMLE produces substantially improved empirical Bayes predictions of the true covariate when its distribution is skewed.},

The models in the framework, called generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM) and consist of a response model and a structural model for the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs to incorporate factor structures in addition to random intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced with different numbers of lower-level units in the higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of response processes can be modeled including ordered and unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of mixed types. The structural model is similar to the structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. For example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a freely available program running in Stata.},

  abstract = {Generalized linear models with covariate measurement error can be estimated by maximum likelihood using gllamm, a program that fits a large class of multilevel latent variable models (Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles 2004). The program uses adaptive quadrature to evaluate the log likelihood, producing more reliable results than many other methods (Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles 2002). For a single covariate measured with error (assuming a classical measurement model), we describe a ``wrapper'' command, cme, that calls gllamm to estimate the model. The wrapper makes life easy for the user by accepting a simple syntax and data structure and producing extended and easily interpretable output. The commands for preparing the data and running gllamm can also be obtained from cme. We first discuss the case where several measurements are available and subsequently consider estimation when the measurement error variance is instead assumed known. The latter approach is useful for sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of assuming perfectly measured covariates in generalized linear models. An advantage of using gllamm directly is that the classical covariate measurement error model can be extended in various ways. For instance, we can use nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE) to relax the normality assumption for the true covariate. We can also specify a congeneric measurement model which relaxes the assumption that the measurements for a unit are exchangeable replicates by allowing for different measurement scales and error variances.},

The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton\textendash Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

The models developed were motivated by applications in cognitive neuroscience, and two case studies are presented. First, we show how GALAMMs can jointly model the complex lifespan trajectories of episodic memory, working memory, and speed/executive function, measured by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), digit span tests, and Stroop tests, respectively. Next, we study the effect of socioeconomic status on brain structure, using data on education and income together with hippocampal volumes estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. By combining semiparametric estimation with latent variable modeling, GALAMMs allow a more realistic representation of how brain and cognition vary across the lifespan, while simultaneously estimating latent traits from measured items. Simulation experiments suggest that model estimates are accurate even with moderate sample sizes.},

Various authors have proposed approximate Bayesian interval estimates for such models, based on extensions of the work of Wahba, G.

This paper aims to improve this situation by providing simulation tests and obtaining asymptotic results supporting the approximations employed for the generalized case. The simulation results suggest that while across-the-model performance is good, component-wise coverage probabilities are not as reliable. Since this is likely to result from the neglect of smoothing parameter variability, a simple and efficient simulation method is proposed to account for smoothing parameter uncertainty: this is demonstrated to substantially improve the performance of component-wise intervals.},

  abstract = {Tensor product smooths provide the natural way of representing smooth interaction terms in regression models because they are invariant to the units in which the covariates are measured, hence avoiding the need for arbitrary decisions about relative scaling of variables. They would also be the natural way to represent smooth interactions in mixed regression models, but for the fact that the tensor product constructions proposed to date are difficult or impossible to estimate using most standard mixed modelling software. This paper proposes a new approach to the construction of tensor product smooths, which allows the smooth to be written as the sum of some fixed effects and some sets of i.i.d. Gaussian random effects: no previously published construction achieves this. Because of the simplicity of this random effects structure, our construction is useable with almost any flexible mixed modelling software, allowing smooth interaction terms to be readily incorporated into any Generalized Linear Mixed Model. To achieve the computationally convenient separation of smoothing penalties, the construction differs from previous tensor product approaches in the penalties used to control smoothness, but the penalties have the advantage over several alternative approaches of being explicitly interpretable in terms of function shape. Like all tensor product smoothing methods, our approach builds up smooth functions of several variables from marginal smooths of lower dimension, but unlike much of the previous literature we treat the general case in which the marginal smooths can be any quadratically penalized basis expansion, and there can be any number of them. We also point out that the imposition of identifiability constraints on smoothers requires more care in the mixed model setting than it would in a simple additive model setting, and show how to deal with the issue. An interesting side effect of our construction is that an ANOVA-decomposition of the smooth can be read off from the estimates, although this is not our primary focus. We were motivated to undertake this work by applied problems in the analysis of abundance survey data, and two examples of this are presented.},

The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with 'knot placement' that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.}
