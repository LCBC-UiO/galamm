(2015) details. can now start confirming able compute likelihood model. marginal_likelihood function returns deviance, can compare PLmixed: marginal_likelihood function also returns gradient marginal likelihood respect \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\lambda\\), order. Reassuringly, close zero. however PLmixed returns maximum profile likelihood, albeit consistent, maximum likelihood estimate (Gong Samaniego 1981; Parke 1986; Pawitan 2001). gradient computed algorithmic differentiation using autodiff C++ library (Leal 2018), means exact computer precision. Hessian also positive definite, note setting compute_hessian = TRUE typically increases runtime. can use gradient find maximum likelihood estimates model (technically, Laplace approximate marginal maximum likelihood estimates). also use memoise avoid evaluating function unnecessarily. start optimization pretty arbitrary values, converges quite fast, solution identical one PLmixed found: can confirm parameters almost identical:  also clear reader PLmixed MUCH convenient use. However, optimization shown faster:","code":"dat <- IRTsub dat$abil.sid <- 1 library(lme4) #> Loading required package: Matrix lmod <- lFormula(form, data = dat, REML = FALSE) X <- lmod$X Zt <- lmod$reTrms$Zt diff(Zt@p) #>   [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #>  [38] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #>  [75] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #> [112] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #> [149] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #> [186] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #> [223] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #> [260] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 #> [297] 2 2 2 2 lambda_mapping_Zt <- rep(dat$item, each = 2) - 2L Lambdat <- lmod$reTrms$Lambdat theta_mapping <- lmod$reTrms$Lind - 1L ml <- marginal_likelihood(   y = dat$y,   trials = rep(1, length(dat$y)),   X = X,   Zt = Zt,   Lambdat = Lambdat,   beta = fixef(irt.model),   theta = getME(irt.model$lme4, \"theta\"),   theta_mapping = theta_mapping,   lambda = irt.model$Lambda[[1]][, \"abil.sid\", drop = TRUE][2:3],   lambda_mapping_X = integer(),   lambda_mapping_Zt = lambda_mapping_Zt,   family = \"gaussian\",   maxit_conditional_modes = 1,    compute_hessian = TRUE ) -2 * irt.model$`Log-Likelihood` #> [1] 387.1267 ml$deviance #> [1] 387.1267 ml$gradient #> [1]  2.438536e-06  3.918029e-06 -4.560885e-13 -3.495071e-13 -8.686057e-13 #> [6]  4.070702e-05 -3.101126e-05 qr(ml$hessian)$rank #> [1] 7 dim(ml$hessian) #> [1] 7 7 library(memoise) theta_inds <- 1:2 beta_inds <- 3:5 lambda_inds <- 6:7 bounds <- c(0, 0, rep(-Inf, 5))  mlwrapper <- function(par){   marginal_likelihood(     y = dat$y,     trials = rep(1, length(dat$y)),     X = X,     Zt = Zt,     Lambdat = Lambdat,     beta = par[beta_inds],     theta = par[theta_inds],     theta_mapping = theta_mapping,     lambda = par[lambda_inds],     lambda_mapping_X = integer(),     lambda_mapping_Zt = lambda_mapping_Zt,     family = \"gaussian\",     maxit_conditional_modes = 1     ) }  mlmem <- memoise(mlwrapper) fn <- function(par){   mlmem(par)$deviance } gr <- function(par){   mlmem(par)$gradient } par_init <- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1) opt <- optim(par_init, fn = fn, gr = gr,               method = \"L-BFGS-B\", lower = bounds)  opt$value #> [1] 387.1267 -2 * irt.model$`Log-Likelihood` #> [1] 387.1267 plot(   opt$par,    c(getME(irt.model$lme4, \"theta\"), fixef(irt.model),      irt.model$Lambda[[1]][2:3, 1]),   xlab = \"optim()\", ylab = \"PLmixed\");
