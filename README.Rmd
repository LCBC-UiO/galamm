galamm estimates generalized additive latent and mixed models (GALAMMs). The model framework and the computational algorithms were introduced in @sorensenLongitudinalModelingAgeDependent2023, which is  [freely available from Psychometrika](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-023-09910-z). It is an extension of the GLLAMM framework for multilevel latent variable modeling detailed in @rabe-heskethGeneralizedMultilevelStructural2004 and @skrondalGeneralizedLatentVariable2004, in particular by efficiently handling crossed random effects and semiparametric estimation.

## What Can the Package Do?

Many applications, particularly in the social sciences, require modeling capabilities beyond what is easily supported and computationally feasible with popular R packages like [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mgcv) [@woodGeneralizedAdditiveModels2017a], [lavaan](https://lavaan.ugent.be/) [@rosseelLavaanPackageStructural2012], [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lme4) [@batesFittingLinearMixedEffects2015], and [OpenMx](https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu/) [@nealeOpenMxExtendedStructural2016], as well as the Stata based [GLLAMM](http://www.gllamm.org/) software [@rabe-heskethGeneralizedMultilevelStructural2004;@rabe-heskethMaximumLikelihoodEstimation2005]. In particular, to maximally utilize large datasets available today, it is typically necessary to combine tools from latent variable modeling, hierarchical modeling, and semiparametric estimation. While this is possible with Bayesian hierarchical models and tools like [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), it requires considerable expertise and may be beyond scope for a single data analysis project. 

The goal of galamm is to enable estimation of models with an arbitrary number of grouping levels, both crossed and hierarchical, and any combination of the following features (click the links to go to the relevant vignette):

- [Linear mixed models with factor structures](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/lmm_factor.html).
- [Generalized linear mixed models with factor structures](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/glmm_factor.html).
- [Linear mixed models with heteroscedastic residuals](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/lmm_heteroscedastic.html).
- [Mixed models with mixed response types](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/mixed_response.html).
- [Generalized additive mixed models with factor structures](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/semiparametric.html).
- [Interactions between latent and observed covariates](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/latent_observed_interaction.html).

Random effects are defined using [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lme4) syntax, and the syntax for factor structures are close to that of [PLmixed](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PLmixed) [@rockwoodEstimatingComplexMeasurement2019]. However, for the types of models supported by both PLmixed and galamm, galamm is usually considerably faster. Smooth terms, as in generalized additive mixed models, use the same syntax as [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mgcv).

For most users, it should not be necessary to think about how the actual computations are performed, although they are detailed in the [optimization vignette](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/optimization.html). In short, the core computations are done using sparse matrix methods supported by [RcppEigen](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppEigen) [@batesFastElegantNumerical2013] and automatic differentiation using the C++ library [autodiff](https://autodiff.github.io/) [@lealAutodiffModernFast2018]. Scaling of the algorithm is investigated further in [the vignette on computational scaling](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/scaling.html).

## Where Do I Start?

To get started, take a look at the [introductory vignette](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/galamm/articles/galamm.html).

## Installation

Install the package from CRAN using

``` r
install.packages("galamm")
```

You can install the development version of galamm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("LCBC-UiO/galamm")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(galamm)
```


### Mixed Response Model

The dataframe `mresp` contains simulated data with mixed response types.

```{r}
head(mresp)
```

Responses in rows with `itemgroup = "a"` are normally distributed while those in rows with `itemgroup = "b"` are binomially distributed. For a given subject, identified by the `id` variable, both responses are associated with the same underlying latent variable. We hence need to model this process jointly, and the model is set up as follows:


```{r, message=FALSE}
mixed_resp <- galamm(
  formula = y ~ x + (0 + loading | id),
  data = mresp,
  family = c(gaussian, binomial),
  family_mapping = ifelse(mresp$itemgroup == "a", 1L, 2L),
  load.var = "itemgroup",
  lambda = list(matrix(c(1, NA), ncol = 1)),
  factor = list("loading")
)
```

The summary function gives some information about the model fit.

```{r}
summary(mixed_resp)
```


### Generalized Additive Mixed Model with Factor Structures

The dataframe `cognition` contains simulated for which latent ability in three cognitive domains is measured across time. We focus on the first cognitive domain, and estimate a smooth trajectory for how the latent ability depends on time.

We start by reducing the data.

```{r}
dat <- subset(cognition, domain == 1)
dat$item <- factor(dat$item)
```

Next we define the matrix of factor loadings, where `NA` denotes unknown values to be estimated.

```{r}
loading_matrix <- matrix(c(1, NA, NA), ncol = 1)
```

We then compute the model estimates, containing both a smooth term for the latent ability and random intercept for subject and timepoints.

```{r}
mod <- galamm(
  formula = y ~ 0 + item + sl(x, factor = "loading") +
    (0 + loading | id / timepoint),
  data = dat,
  load.var = "item",
  lambda = list(loading_matrix),
  factor = list("loading")
)
```

We finally plot the estimated smooth term.

```{r}
plot_smooth(mod)
```
