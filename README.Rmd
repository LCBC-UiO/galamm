galamm is an R package for fitting multivariate generalized additive mixed models with factor structures. The package is currently under development, and changes to the API must be expected. 

The package uses an interface similar to [PLmixed](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PLmixed), which fits generalized linear mixed models with factor structures. However, galamm allows semiparametric estimations with [gamm4](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gamm4), and hence more flexibly allows estimation of nonlinear effects.

The plan for the package is to provide tool for fast and scalable estimation of generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMMs) [@rabe-heskethGeneralizedMultilevelStructural2004] and their semiparametric extensions which we have termed generalized additive latent and mixed models (GALAMMs) [@sorensenLongitudinalModelingAgeDependent2023]. This is already possible to some extent, using the function `marginal_likelihood`, as is documented in the vignette on maximum likelihood estimation. To obtain this, we combine sparse matrix computations with RcppEigen [@batesFastElegantNumerical2013] and automatic differentiation using the C++ library [autodiff](https://autodiff.github.io/) [@lealAutodiffModernFast2018].

## Installation

You can install the development version of galamm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("LCBC-UiO/galamm")
```
## Example

For now, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/galamm-scripts) for code that can be used to reproduce the results of @sorensenLongitudinalModelingAgeDependent2023.
